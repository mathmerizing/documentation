Installation guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Clone repository: TODO...

Install requirements: 
*********************
Open a terminal in the repository folder and execute ::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

.. note::

   Please let us know, if we forgot to list some dependencies or if you have any problems with the installation.

Build documentation:
********************
Building the documentation yourself is not necessary, since we have already done that for you.
If you still want to do that, follow these steps:

1. If you added some files, navigate to the folder ``documentation`` and run ::

     sphinx-apidoc --separate -a -o ./source ..

2. Then go to the folder ``documentation`` and execute the command ::

     make clean html

The documentation is now built and can be viewed by opening ``documentation/build/html/index.html``.
